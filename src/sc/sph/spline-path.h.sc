(sc-comment
  "* spline-path creates discrete 2d paths interpolated between some given points
   * maps from one independent value to one dependent continuous value
   * only the dependent value is returned
   * kept minimal (only 2d, only selected generates, limited segment count) to be extremely fast
   * negative independent values are not supported
   * segments-count must be greater than zero
   * multidimensional interpolation could only be archieved with multiple configs and calls
   * a copy of segments is made internally and only the copy is used
   * uses points as structs because pre-defined size arrays can not be used in structs
   * segments must be a valid spline-path segment configuration
   * generates are called with path-relative start/end inside segment and with out positioned at offset for this start/end block
   * all segment types require a fixed number of given points. line: 1, bezier: 3, move: 1, constant: 0, path: 0
   * segments start at the previous point or (0 0)
   * bezier interpolation assume that output array values are set to zero before use
   * segments draw from the start point inclusive to end point exclusive
   * both dimensions are float types for precision with internal calculations")
